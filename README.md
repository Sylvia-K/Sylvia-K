- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sylvia-K
- 👀 I’m interested in designing embedded systems. Engineering design, especially electronics design, is my cup of tea.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things tbh. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that's at that sweet spot between hardware and software.
- 📫 How to reach me: Besides here you mean?
